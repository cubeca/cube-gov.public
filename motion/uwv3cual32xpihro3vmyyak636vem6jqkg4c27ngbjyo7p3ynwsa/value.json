Mainly, not to use artists’ images, artworks, intellectual property for advertising and marketing purposes.\r\n\r\nPart our loan agreements with the artists we work with have clauses that prevent their images, artworks, and identities from being altered in any way. As a gallery institution, we have the ability to maintain that control with content we share through our website. Extending that content to CubeCommons puts another entity inside the relationship between the artists, us as the gallery, and the audiences we engage. It would benefit NMG as users of CubeCommons to be able to have an option to designate certain content as unavailable to be used by the platform for advertising and marketing purposes. When uploading content, we would like to be able to opt out of even partial use of the content so as the maintain the integrity of the artist’s intellectual property.","labels":["gov4git:managed"],"frozen":false,"closed":false,"cancelled":false,"archived":false,"score":{"attention":5},"ref_by":null,"ref_to":null}
