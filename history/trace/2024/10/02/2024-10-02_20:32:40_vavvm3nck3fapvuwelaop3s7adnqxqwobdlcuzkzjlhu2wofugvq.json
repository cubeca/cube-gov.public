The Search still seems awkward.\r\n\r\n1) From clicking on Search it takes me to the search page but it says \"Welcome\" which is confusing.  Take out the word welcome. \r\n\r\n2) Also there should be no scrolling on the search page to get to the search bar. I would suggest moving it up above the highlights gallery, so it is immediately accessible.\r\n\r\n3) I think we should make the search input a different colour because it is hard to see. The Search bar itself is not too visible. It looks very similar to text and headings. \r\n","labels":["gov4git:managed"],"frozen":false,"closed":false,"cancelled":false,"archived":false,"score":{"attention":0},"ref_by":null,"ref_to":null}}}}
